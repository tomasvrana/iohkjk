<h2>What is IOHK?</h2>
Founded in 2015 by <strong>Jeremy Wood</strong> and <strong>Charles Hoskinson</strong>, IOHK is a <strong>Hong Kong-</strong>based technology company committed to using peer-to-peer innovations to provide financial services to the three billion people who don't have them. We are an engineering company that builds <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong> and <strong>block chains</strong> for academic institutions, government entities and corporations. We are a decentralized company that loves small innovative teams forming and executing ideas that cause cascading disruption.
<h2>What is cascading disruption?</h2>
It's the founding principle of <strong>IOHK</strong>. Cascading disruption is the idea that most of the structures that form the world's financial, governance and social systems are inherently unstable and thus minor perturbations can cause a ripple effect that fundamentally reconfigures the entire system. Our company is committed to identifying and developing technology to force these perturbations in order to push towards a more fair and transparent order.
<h2>What projects do we work on?</h2>
Currently <strong>IOHK</strong> is studying new tools and paradigms for <strong>cryptographic research</strong> and the <strong>architecture of cryptocurrencies</strong>. More specifically, we are collaboratively developing an open source library for universal composability and <a href="https://github.com/ScorexProject/Scorex-Lagonaki" target="_blank">the <strong>Scorex</strong> project</a>. We also do for-profit work aligned with our mission, vision and goals.
<h2>What is the mission of IOHK?</h2>
We view the world as a series of giant and mostly interconnected social graphs with hundreds of complex systems embedded. Our mission is to perturb the graphs to a more connected, transparent and fair configuration for both the flow of ideas and value.
<h2>Who is behind IOHK?</h2>
In addition to our founders, <strong>IOHK</strong> enjoys having a diverse, geographically distributed team of engineers, scientists, business professionals, a few teachers and open-source collaborators. We are always looking for new team members and partnerships.
